# Results Directory

This directory contains the results of the model training and evaluation.

## Contents
- `CNN_classification_report.csv`: Classification report for the CNN model.
- `LSTM_classification_report.csv`: Classification report for the RNN model.
- `cnn/`: Contains additional results specific to the CNN model.
  - `cnn_classification_report.csv`: Detailed classification report.
  - `cnn_confusion_matrix.png`: Confusion matrix for CNN model.
- `f1-score_comparison_models.png`: Comparison of F1 scores between models.

## Interpretation
The results indicate that the CNN model outperforms the RNN model in terms of accuracy and F1 score. The confusion matrices provide insight into the types of arrhythmias that are most frequently misclassified.
