# Results Directory

This directory contains the results of the model training and evaluation.

## Contents
- `cnn`
- `comparison`
- `hyperparameter_tuning`

## Interpretation
The results indicate that the CNN model outperforms the RNN model in terms of accuracy and F1 score. The confusion matrices provide insight into the types of arrhythmias that are most frequently misclassified.
