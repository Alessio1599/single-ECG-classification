## Here I will explain better the training process
In order to train the model we have to deine the architecture (number of layers, etc.).
- particular layers to avoid overfitting
- activation functions

In addition to that we have to define
- optimizer
- Learning rate
  - warmup of the LR
- loss function
- number of epochs

## I can check on Stack Overflow, to see how they usually implement the learning rate schedule !!!
