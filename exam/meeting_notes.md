# Meeting Notes


## Meeting 2024-12-04

### Agenda
1. Comparison with other models
2. Final training of the model
3. LR scheduling

### Notes
- **Comparison** Is it enough only one model, or I should find another one? And is it sufficient a comparison of F1-score across the classes
- **Final training of model**. Should I merge the training and validation set after the hyperparameter tuning?
- **Only CNN**. Is it fine if I only trained the CNN?

### Hyperparameter tuning
- **Early terminate hyperband**, Idk if I should use it, since the things, do not require that much of time, maybe that functionality is better when a run requires a lot of time...
- **Learning rate**
- **Looking at the results that I obtained**
  - 30 runs are fine?

### Organization
- Any suggestions on how to organize the things
  - After a while I got overwhelmed with a lot of files
  - Do you have any reccomendation, references, that I can follow
- I should everytime save the results in a specific folder

> Sono un pò cotto ora, perchè è da tanto che ci sto lavorando


### MEETING WITH PROFESSOR
> Ask questions to the professor, in this way you can learn a lot 

-  ask if the hyperparameter tuned are fine, or if I should try also a different combination of the hyperparameters
  - **RNN**. Idk why I cannot obtain good performance when I use the RNN
