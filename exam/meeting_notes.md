# Meeting Notes


## Meeting 2024-12-04

### Agenda
1. Comparison with other models
2. Final training of the model
3. LR scheduling

### Notes
- **Comparison** Is it enough only one model, or I should find another one? And is it sufficient a comparison of F1-score across the classes
- **Final training of model**. Should I merge the training and validation set after the hyperparameter tuning?
- **Only CNN**. Is it fine if I only trained the CNN?


### MEETING WITH PROFESSOR
> Ask questions to the professor, in this way you can learn a lot 

-  ask if the hyperparameter tuned are fine, or if I should try also a different combination of the hyperparameters
  - **RNN**. Idk why I cannot obtain good performance when I use the RNN
